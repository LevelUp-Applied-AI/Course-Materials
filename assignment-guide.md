# Assignment Guide – Pilot Program

This guide explains how weekly assignments work in this program.  
Each week you will complete four streams of assignments that build on each other: **Drill, Lab, Integration, and Review & Reflect**.

---

## Weekly Assignment Streams

### 1. Core Skills Drill
- **Length:** 15–25 minutes
- **Format:** Small practice exercises (CLI, Git, Python/Pandas, spaCy, Hugging Face, Weaviate, SPARQL, Docker, FastAPI).
- **Goal:** Quick practice to reinforce core concepts and build confidence.
- **Grading:** Completion only (autograded).

---

### 2. Applied Lab
- **Length:** 1.5–2.0 hours
- **Format:** Scaffolded, CPU-friendly coding lab with unit tests provided.
- **Goal:** Practice applying the week’s concept in code. Learn testing and debugging (`red/green/refactor`).
- **Grading:** Based on unit tests + rubric.

---

### 3. Integration Task
- **Length:** 2–3 hours
- **Format:** A “real” artifact that connects your lab work into the broader course deliverables.
- **Examples:** Add a FastAPI route, hybrid retrieval, SPARQL join, or monitoring counter.
- **Requirements:**
  - Create a pull request (PR) with description
  - Update README minimally
  - Ensure reproducibility (Makefile or conda/poetry env; docker compose if relevant)
- **Grading:** Rubric-based, focused on quality and reproducibility.

---

### 4. Review & Reflect
- **Length:** 30–45 minutes
- **Format:**
  - Peer Code Review: Review 1 teammate’s PR using a checklist
  - Reflection: Short write-up (what worked, what broke, trade-offs, next step)
  - Readiness Signal: 5–8 item quiz or “ticket-to-merge” checklist
- **Goal:** Practice professional collaboration, reflection, and signaling readiness.
- **Grading:** Light but mandatory.

---

## Weekly Rhythm

- **Monday:** Lead lecture/demo; Drill + Lab released (Drill due same day, Lab due Wednesday)  
- **Tuesday:** Support-led labs, TA office hours (no deliverables due)  
- **Wednesday:** Integration task released; team checkpoint stand-up  
- **Thursday:** Support labs, Peer Reviews open  
- **Friday:** Integration Task due; Team Demo; Reflection + Readiness Check due  

---

## Submissions & Feedback

- **Submissions:** All work is submitted via GitHub pull requests.  
- **Autograding:** Unit tests run automatically when you push code.  
- **TA Feedback:** Within ~48 hours on labs and integration tasks.  
- **Instructor Feedback:** Within ~72 hours on integration tasks.  
- **Peer Reviews:** Must be submitted within 24 hours after your teammate’s PR is assigned.  

---

## Team Demos
Each Friday ends with a **lightning demo**:
- 2–3 minute walkthrough of your week’s Integration Task
- Focus: What you built, what worked, one key challenge
- Builds community and peer learning
- Graded lightly (completion/participation)

---

## Tips for Success
- **Start early.** Labs and integration tasks take time.  
- **Keep code reproducible.** If a teammate can’t run it, it’s not done.  
- **Commit often, write clear messages.** Git history is part of professional practice.  
- **Engage in peer review.** You learn as much from reviewing as from being reviewed.  
- **Use office hours.** Instructors and TAs are here to help.

## Summary
Each week you will:
- Complete **1 Drill**  
- Complete **1 Lab**  
- Complete **1 Integration Task**  
- Do **1 Peer Review + Reflection + Readiness Check**  
- Participate in **1 Team Demo**

This structure mirrors professional software practice: building, testing, integrating, reviewing, and reflecting — all in weekly cycles.
