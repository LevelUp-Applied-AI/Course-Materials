# Code of Conduct

LevelUp courses are designed to create a collaborative, respectful, and professional learning environment. By participating in this program, all learners, instructors, and staff agree to uphold the following standards of conduct.

## 1. Respect & Inclusion
- Treat all participants with dignity, courtesy, and professionalism.
- Listen actively and respect differing viewpoints, experiences, and cultural contexts.
- Use inclusive language in discussions, code comments, and written work.
- Discrimination, harassment, or disrespectful behavior of any kind will not be tolerated.

## 2. Collaboration & Integrity
- Share knowledge generously and provide constructive feedback.

- Do not claim others’ work as your own. Academic honesty applies to all assignments, projects, and code.

- Keep communication clear, professional, and solution-oriented.
- Raise questions, challenges, or issues early and with openness to feedback.

## 4. Learning Environment
- Follow the weekly assignment structure and deadlines to support your team’s success.
- Use GitHub responsibly: commit regularly, write clear commit messages, and respect branch protection rules.
- Maintain reproducibility in your work (e.g., environment files, documentation) to ensure others can build on your contributions.
- Actively participate in labs, peer reviews, and demos; these are essential to the learning cycle.

## 5. Accountability
- If you make a mistake, own it, correct it, and learn from it — mistakes are part of growth.
- If you witness conduct that violates this Code, report it privately to the instructional staff.
- Violations may result in warnings, removal from activities, or dismissal from the program depending on severity.

## 6. Commitment to Growth
- Approach challenges with curiosity, persistence, and respect for the Build Cycle: doing, reflecting, adjusting, and building with progressive complexity.
- Support your peers in developing lasting capability and confidence.
- Recognize that this is a professional training environment, and conduct yourself as you would in a workplace.
