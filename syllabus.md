# Course Syllabus

**Dates & Duration:** TBD  
**Delivery Mode:** Hybrid (CPU-friendly)  
**Target Learners:** Recent CS/EE graduates

## Course Overview
This pilot equips learners with the technical and collaborative skills to design, build, and deploy secure applied NLP systems. Students progress from foundational Python and data science into advanced NLP, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Knowledge Graphs (KG), culminating in a capstone solving domain-relevant problems.

Learning follows the **LevelUp Build Cycle**: cycles of doing, reflecting, adjusting, and building with progressive complexity.

## Learning Outcomes
Graduates will be able to:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}:
- Collaborate on AI projects with Git branching and reproducible environments.
- Apply Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib) for data wrangling and visualization.
- Build and test models with PyTorch/TensorFlow.
- Preprocess multilingual text, perform tokenization, NER, and embeddings.
- Fine-tune Transformers for classification, QA, summarization, or sentiment tasks.
- Implement RAG pipelines with dense, sparse, and hybrid retrieval (Weaviate).
- Construct and reason over Knowledge Graphs with entity linking and KG completion.
- Use triple stores (Blazegraph/Fuseki) and SPARQL for semantic queries.
- Integrate NLP outputs with ontologies for entity disambiguation.
- Deploy AI applications using FastAPI + Next.js with Docker/Compose.
- Monitor deployed services for latency, error rates, and answer quality.
- Deliver a capstone demonstrating end-to-end applied NLP, RAG, and KG.
